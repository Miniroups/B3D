      <h3>Our history</h3>
      <p>Our company is located in Poussignac in the Lot-et-Garonne at the gates of the Landes massif and closer to the forest resource. In the 80s, my father built a maritime pine sawmill closed in 2015. In 2018, after working in various organizations and companies in the wood industry, I chose to return to the family site to install a plant. wood stakes manufacturing. <br> <br> With 20 years of experience in the wood industry, I wanted to go back to basics by settling in the old family sawmill located closer to the forest resource . <br> I specialized in the manufacture of pickets and logs of acacia, pine or chestnut. <br> <br> My flexible and flexible production tool makes it possible to produce poles or rounded logs of different dimensions. <br> <br> For growers, landscapers, arboriculturists, or just for individuals wanting to create a fence or garden, stakes or logs B3D are a safe bet.</p>

      <h3>Our expertise</h3>
      <p>The presence of a variety of local wood species has guided my choice on a flexible and flexible transformation tool to produce acacia, pine and chestnut stakes of different sizes. Depending on the species and the diameter of the processed wood, two operations are carried out. <br> <br> A planing operation to bring a planed and smooth surface to the round woods or a slot operation allowing to follow the thread of the wood and maintain the mechanical strength of wood and avoid drying deformations. As a sanitary precaution a debarking operation is carried out for each species of wood. <br> <br> This operation makes it possible to avoid carrying any parasites such as xylophagous insects on the site of the clientele. Customer satisfaction is our primary goal and product quality control is achieved at every stage of processing.</p>

      <h3>Our products</h3>
      <p>Our stakes and logs are produced from logs operated within a radius of 70 km. The pine comes from thinning cuttings planted after the 1999 storm. <br> <br> These juvenile woods commonly used for the establishment of anti-hail nets or trellising have a very low proportion of heartwood giving them very good ability to autoclave treatment. <br> <br> Our acacia logs have a very small amount of sapwood and tight growth rings giving the wood excellent natural durability and very good mechanical strength. > <br> All of our wood comes from sustainably managed cuts and generally benefits from PEFC certification.</p>
